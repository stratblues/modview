# ModView

## Overview
**ModView** is a 3D model viewer for testing lighting algorithms and other parallel computations. The goal is to create a multithreaded system revolving around an entity-component based architecture while utilizing SDL_gpu for cross-platform, GPU agnostic compute; all while maintaining a structured hirearchy of TLP, DLP, and ILP. The result should be a low-latency, high-throughput system to increase quality and speed of rendering algorithms. 

## rough outline of planned features
- Window management integrated with the render system and full GPU pipeline
- Multithreaded Entity–Component–System (ECS) architecture
- 3D model loading
