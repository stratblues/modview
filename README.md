# ModView


**ModView** is a 3D model viewer for testing lighting algorithms and other parallel computations. The goal is to create a multithreaded system revolving around an entity-component based architecture while utilizing SDL_gpu for cross-platform, GPU agnostic compute; all while maintaining a structured hirearchy of TLP, DLP, and ILP. The result should be a low-latency, high-throughput system to increase quality and speed of rendering algorithms. 

## rough outline of planned features
- Window management integrated with the render system and full GPU pipeline
- Multithreaded Entity–Component–System (ECS) architecture
- 3D model loading




## notes and philosophy 
  all of the code in this repository has been written without the use of a large language model. LLM's certainly have their place in software, but the purpose of this project is to push the boundaries of modern systems and create something new  - LLM's do not have the ability to do this. The capabilities of humans to reason and think beyond what has already been created is what characterizes our superior intelligence as a species. But would my application be "better" otherwise? That question is purely subjective. Programming is as much an act of artistic expression and creation as it is a measurable science, and so I guess this is my own artistic choice.
